# Learn-Me-a-Haskell-For-Great-Good
A clumsy foray into the realm of functional programming. The Projects herein will be as follows:

# Silly Binary Logic!
Among my preferred exercises to familiarize myself with a new language is to create a set of functions that perform basic arithmetic using only boolean logic.

# Fizz! Buzz!
from http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest :
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
